# Terraform-Project
Creating a terraform script to create an AWS EC2 instance 
Deploying that ec2 instance on a custom VPC
assigning a public IP address to connect to it 
And automatically installing an apache webserver to handle web traffic
Note- when running terraform init command a state file will be created as well. 
The primary purpose of Terraform state is to store bindings between objects in a remote system and resource instances declared in your configuration.
